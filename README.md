## Version control structure

We have a **structured version control**, in order to control how many changes, corrections, new features have been added to the application since its previous update. We will explain an example of how version control is structured.

For example we have this version **1.6.27.8**, this version is structured as follows.

```bash
1. Number of major updates.
6. Number of days elapsed since the last update.
27. Number of new features added.
8. Number of changes. Bug fixes and code improvements.
```

This version control applies to all version names of the application.

## Important notes

- The tests must be executed with the authorization of the administrator and all events, problems or actions carried out with the client must be informed.
- The client can only be tested by assistant administrators and some moderators, to avoid unwanted data leakage.

Reporting any important problem is recommended so that it can be corrected by high-ranking administrators and prevent the end customer from being affected by damaging the platform. Please inform all of this to high-ranking administrators or make a "Failure Report" in the API repository.
